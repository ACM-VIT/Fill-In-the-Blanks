Youâ€™ve lost random parts of your images. You need some mechanism to make your image set presentable again. Use your skill in Machine Learning to achieve this.

## Overview

### Idea
Fill in the Blanks, but with Images!

### Explanation
The aim is to build a deep learning model, that takes as input an image with a missing rectangular portion and a boolean mask indicating its location, and imagines the missing content. The basic set of packages can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed using the pip command from usage section. The suggested dataset consists of images of various indoor scenes. Use the provided code to create the blanks in the images.
Packages used are: TensorFlow for creating and training the model, NumPy for handling arrays, MatPlotLib for image output.

## Dataset
[Indoor Scenes [2.4GB tar]](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/LabelMe/NewImages/indoorCVPR_09.tar)

### Code to create the blanks
```python
def random_rect(img, area):
  assert 0<=area<=1, "area should be a valid fraction"

  a, b = np.random.uniform(), np.random.uniform()
  a, b = math.sqrt(area*a/b), math.sqrt(area*b/a)
  if a>1:
    a = 1
    b = area
  elif b>1:
    a = area
    b = 1
  
  sx, sy = np.random.uniform(low = 0, high = 1-a), np.random.uniform(low = 0, high = 1-b)
  ex, ey = sx+a, sy+b
  sx, sy = math.floor(sx*img.shape[0]), math.floor(sy*img.shape[1])
  ex, ey = math.floor(ex*img.shape[0]), math.floor(ey*img.shape[1])
    
  rect_img = img.copy()
  rect_img[sx:ex, sy:ey, :] = 0

  
  mask = np.zeros(img.shape[:2])
  mask[sx:ex,sy:ey] = 1
  
  return rect_img, mask
```
